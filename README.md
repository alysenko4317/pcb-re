# Reverse Engineering Schematics of Power Electronics

This repository contains reverse-engineered schematics of various power electronics devices. All schematics are manually traced and drawn by me during my free time, mostly as part of repair processes. 

## About the Schematics

- **Work in Progress**: The schematics do not claim to be fully complete or accurate. They are created as a personal effort to document and analyze the circuits for repair and educational purposes.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Sprint Layout**: Used for PCB tracing and layout.
  - **sPlan**: Used for creating circuit schematics.
- **Methodology**: 
  - PCBs are traced using photos as templates to assist in schematic creation.
  - For surface-mounted device (SMD) components, I rely on stitched microscope images for better accuracy.
  - The quality of the Sprint Layout projects is not intended for actual PCB fabrication but for schematic analysis.

## Contribution and Disclaimer

This is a personal project maintained in my spare time. Contributions are welcome, but please note that the repository serves primarily as a documentation effort and a repair aid.
